Proposed Level of Achievement:
Apollo 11

Project Scope (Summarised):
To create a web application where users are able to store and track their stocks on a dentralised dashboard where their profile is protected with their login details 

Project Scope (Expanded):
We want to create a web application that is easy to use where users are able to access data that they have previously keyed. This data will be tied to their individual accounts and can be editted to their preference. Users of the app should have the freedom to add, remove, and modify the stocks and the quantity of those stocks in their portfolio according to their preference. This is necessary as the stock market is ever changing and the liberity to change their portfolio is a key feature for investors.

The application would automatically help them calculate their total asset value and their Gain/Loss on their position. At a glance, users of the app should be able to see 2 key sets of information; how their stocks are performing and their total asset value.


Motivation: Being avid finance enthusiasts, justin and alvern have tried many financial applications to experiment with the stock market. During the covid-19 pandemic, there were many attractive promotions and deals for stock brokers, leading to us having stocks on multiple platforms. Furthermore with the boom in popularity of Cryptocurrency and most platforms not supporting it, it led to us having even more platforms where we track and store our investments. 

All was well and good for a while, until we realised that having investments across multiple platforms had its disadvantageous. Furthermore, with how much the markets fluctuate and given the risky nature of these investments, it has been increasingly more important for us investors to manage our investments. It became confusing toggling between so many applications to track your stocks, resulting in more work needed to be done to manage them. 


Vision:
InvestMate will be an application for investors to track all their investments that they own on their multiple platforms. They will be able to create and manage their portfolios. 

Investors will then be able to use their investments and portfolios to create personalised investment dashboards. They will be able to select what kind of data they would like to view and manage their investments accordingly.
