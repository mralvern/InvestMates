Project Scope 

Motivation:
Being avid finance enthusiasts, justin and alvern have tried many financial applications to experiment with the stock market. During the covid-19, there were many promotions and deals for stock brokers, leading to investors having stocks on multiple platforms. After a while, it becomes confusing toggling between so many applications to track your stocks.
